# Murder Mystery

This online game was made by Sabrina Zancotti as my final project for the
Technigo frontend developer bootcamp 2021/2022.

The frontend of Murder Mystery was developed in React JS and Redux. The backend
was developed in Node.js using Express API, Moongose and MongoDB for the
backend.
